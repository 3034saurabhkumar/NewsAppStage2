# **NewsAppStage2**

### **Overview**

This is one of my projects for my Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree.

The app downloads data on news articles from the Guardian API and incorporates a settings screen to refine search results.

If you wish to test the app, you will need to get an API key from The Guardian and go to the todo I left in the code to show you
where to insert it.

Here's a video of the app:
